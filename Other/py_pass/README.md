## Description

py_pass is a small python program that can generate or evaluate passwords. Uses 2 command line switches:

python3 script.py   -e    [password]
python3 script.py   -g

Alternative long switches would be --evaluate for -e and --generate for -g.


## Tested Platforms

* Linux Mint 20.3

## Future Plans

- [ ] Improve the program to evaluate passwords with spaces
